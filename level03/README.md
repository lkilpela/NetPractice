## Given:
| Interface | IP Address     | Subnet Mask       | Prefix | 
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| C1        |                | 255.255.255.128   | /25    |
| A1        | 104.198.109.125|                   |        | 
| B1        |                |                   |        |


## Solution:

### Step 1: Determine Subnet Mask for A1 and B1
- Since all devices must communicate with each other and C1 has a subnet mask of `255.255.255.128` (or `/25` prefix), A1 and B1 must be in the same subnet. Therefore, A1 and B1 will also use a subnet mask of `255.255.255.128` and a prefix of `/25`.

### Step 2: Calculate Network Address
- To ensure communication, all devices must be in the same network. The subnet mask of 255.255.255.128 (/25) divides the address space into 2 subnets, each with 128 addresses.
- For A1's IP 104.198.109.125, the network address can be calculated by zeroing out the last 7 bits (since /25 leaves 7 bits for host addresses). However, under time constraints, note that the boundary addresses for any /25 subnet will be in multiples of 128 in the last octet.

### Step 3: Assign IP Addresses to C1 and B1
- Since A1's IP is 104.198.109.125, it falls in the subnet 104.198.109.0/25 if the last octet's value is less than 128, or 104.198.109.128/25 if it's 128 or more. Given 104.198.109.125, it's in the first subnet: 104.198.109.0/25.
- C1 and B1 should have IP addresses within the same subnet. Choose IPs that are not already taken and ensure they are not the network or broadcast address (104.198.109.0 and 104.198.109.127, respectively).

### Solution Summary:
- Subnet Mask for A1 and B1: 255.255.255.128 (/25)
- IP Address for C1: Choose an IP within 104.198.109.1 to 104.198.109.126, avoiding 104.198.109.125. For example, 104.198.109.1.
- IP Address for B1: Choose another IP within the same range, for example, 104.198.109.2.

| Interface | IP Address       | Subnet Mask       | Prefix | 
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| C1        | 104.198.109.1    | 255.255.255.128   | /25    |
| A1        | 104.198.109.125  | 255.255.255.128   | /25    | 
| B1        | 104.198.109.2    | 255.255.255.128   | /25    |
