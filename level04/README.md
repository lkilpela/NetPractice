## Given:
| Interface | IP Address      | Subnet Mask     | Prefix | 
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| R1        |                 |                 |        |
| R2        | 123.247.112.1   | 255.255.255.128 |        | 
| R3        | 123.247.112.244 | 255.255.255.192 |        |
| A1        | 123.247.112.132 |                 |        |
| B1        | 123.247.112.244 | 255.255.255.192 |        |

## Solution

### Step 1: Determine Subnet Masks and Prefixes
- R2's Subnet Mask: Given as 255.255.255.128, which corresponds to a /25 prefix. This means the network is divided into two subnets, each with 128 addresses.
- R3 and B1's Subnet Mask: Given as 255.255.255.192, which corresponds to a /26 prefix. This creates four subnets, each with 64 addresses.

### Step 2: Calculate Network Addresses
- R2's Network: With an IP of 123.247.112.1 and a /25 mask, it's in the first subnet of the /25 division, which is 123.247.112.0/25.
- R3 and B1's Network: With IPs of 123.247.112.244 and a /26 mask, they are in the last subnet of the /26 division, which is 123.247.112.192/26.

### Step 3: Assign Missing IP Addresses and Subnet Masks
- A1: Since A1 is connected to the same switch and presumably needs to communicate with R2, it should be in the same subnet as R2. Given A1's IP is 123.247.112.132, it falls outside R2's 123.247.112.0/25 range. This is an inconsistency unless there's a routing setup allowing communication across different subnets. Typically, A1 should have an IP within 123.247.112.0 to 123.247.112.127 range to be in the same subnet as R2. However, given the IP, A1 seems to be incorrectly placed if it's meant to be directly in the same subnet without routing.
- R1: Without specific details, R1's IP address and subnet mask cannot be precisely determined. However, if R1 is meant to route between these subnets, its interfaces would need IP addresses within each subnet it connects to.

### Step 4: Correcting for A1
- To ensure A1 is in the correct subnet to communicate directly with R2 (assuming no routing between subnets), A1's IP address needs to be within 123.247.112.0/25. However, given the IP 123.247.112.132, it seems to be placed in a different subnet, possibly a mistake or a scenario involving more complex routing.

### Summary of Corrections and Calculations
- R2's Prefix: /25 (implied by the subnet mask).
- R3 and B1's Prefix: /26 (implied by the subnet mask).
- A1's Subnet Mask: Should be 255.255.255.128 to match R2 for direct communication without routing, but its given IP 123.247.112.132 falls outside this range, indicating a potential error or a more complex network setup.
